#### Basically

# this theme rocks.

Got some *killer app*, some *neat project*, a cool portfolio? Make an easy single-page site to show it all off. SinglePaged uses jekyll niceties to make a ***polished, modular, and beautiful* single page site**.

Oh-- go see [some examples](https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged#fancy-jekyll-powered-single-page-site)!

- Each vertical section is a markdown file in **_posts/** directory.
  * They're sorted by 'date'. (we don't use date anywhere, it only sorts)
- Each vertical section sets it's own **color**, **header icon** (or image), **title**, and easy-to-write markdown body.
- Only **two things** to edit:
  1. Edit `_config.yml` to set the site title, description, etc
  2. Add `_posts/*.md` to make each vertical section. Copy some examples and add the sections from your README.md for a fast start!
- Easy adding of **SEO terms**, **favicon** & such, and **google analytics token**.
